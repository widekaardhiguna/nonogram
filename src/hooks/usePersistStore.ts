/**
 * NextJS uses Server Side Rendering, and it will compare the rendered component on the server with the one rendered on client.
 * But since you are using data from browser to change your component, the two renders will differ and Next will throw a warning at you.
 *
 * The errors usually are:
 * - Text content does not match server-rendered HTML
 * - Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server
 * - There was an error while hydrating. Because the error happened outside of a Suspense boundary, the entire root will switch to client rendering
 * To solve these errors, create a custom hook so that Zustand waits a little before changing your components.
